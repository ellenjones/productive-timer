Running example at:

To use, open browser to index.html and set the three target ranges as consecutive pie sections by entering the number of minutes desired for each. (if less than a minute is desired use decimals)
Example:
1, 2, 3 = 6 minute timer

The first range represents incredibly efficient, "excellent" time management. The second range represents average, "good" time management. The third range represents subpar, "needs improvement" time management.

After setting the time for each section, press ENTER while cursor is still in "Needs Improvement" box, or click the "Set Timer" button.
