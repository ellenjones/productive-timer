To use open browser to index.html and set the three target ranges as consecutive pie sections by entering degrees for start and stop of each.
Example:
0-90, 90-180, 180-360

The first range represents incredibly efficient, "excellent" time management. The second range represents average, "good" time management. The third range represents subpar, "needs improvement" time management.

After setting each range press ENTER while cursor is still in "stop" box, or click the "draw" button.

Set timer in minutes and click start or press ENTER. If less than a minute is desire use decimals.
